Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning models to classify news articles as either Fake or Genuine. The dataset is preprocessed and transformed using TF-IDF vectorization, and multiple classification models are trained and evaluated.
ðŸš€ Features

    Preprocessing of news articles (removing URLs, HTML tags, numbers, and punctuation)

    Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical format

    Classification using:

        Logistic Regression

        Decision Tree Classifier

        Random Forest Classifier

        Gradient Boosting Classifier

    Manual testing function for user-input news articles

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

    True.csv â†’ Contains genuine news articles

    Fake.csv â†’ Contains fake news articles

    The datasets are merged and shuffled before training
